🌊 FloodGuardEdge
AI-powered flood prediction and early warning system for Nigerian cities using satellite and environmental data.
📌 Overview
FloodGuardEdge is a smart flood risk mapping tool that uses satellite data and machine learning to detect high-risk areas and send early alerts to communities. It helps emergency agencies, planners, and residents prepare for floods in advance.
🚨 Problem
Urban flooding in Nigeria causes major damage yearly — homes are destroyed, lives are lost, and the economy suffers. Most flood-vulnerable communities lack reliable early warning tools.
💡 Solution
FloodGuardEdge:
- Uses AI to predict flood-prone zones.
- Visualizes flood risk on an interactive map.
- Sends SMS alerts to users in danger zones.
- Is open-source and deployable on local or cloud infrastructure.
🧠 AI Component
We train a machine learning model (Random Forest or CNN) on rainfall, elevation, drainage, and land cover data to classify regions by flood risk level.
